-- STEP 1 --

let eval = content => console.log(content); //redefine eval to print contents, ; is a must since the vm doesn't see the newlines in JSFuck. Without a ; an error is thrown which makes it obvious

-- STEP 2 --

save the output from executing step 1 into a file:

"node step1 > out"

-- STEP 3 --

Notice that there is /* flag += */ commented out, that is the grouping of the whitespace into ascii chars. Create a flag var and console log it.
