Solution:
- opening challange.zip with a text editor, you will see that it appears to be text that ends with an "=" (think base64)
- change the .zip extention to .txt
- upload the new .txt file to https://www.base64decode.org/ ; it will automatically download the decoded file
- change the extesion back to .zip
- the ouput is a .png with a QR code. Scan the code for the flag

- bonus: base64 decode the filename of the .png (omitting ".png")

flag{BuRR1ed_Tr3asur3}
